{"summary":["“Loss and damage” is a term used by the United Nations to describe the harms inflicted by climate change. It can include lives lost; monetary costs from the destruction of infrastructure, buildings, crops and other property; and the loss of entire places or ways of life. In November 2022, the UNFCCC agreed to create and operationalize a fund to help lower-income countries respond to and recover from climate change related harms. However, the details of how large this fund will be, who will pay into it, and how it will be distributed are all still under debate. In summer 2022, when a third of Pakistan was flooded by extreme rains, the crisis was deepened for happening in a country with few spare resources to give food, water, shelter and healthcare to the millions of people displaced. In some places, like low-lying coastal areas lost to sea level rise, no amount of money may be enough to prevent devastating harms fromClimate change. At this point, some harms fromclimate change are inevitable. But through mitigation and adaptation, actions to slow climate change and to better withstand it, there is still time to minimize those harms and create a future where climate change is as manageable as possible.

It can include lives lost; monetary costs from the destruction of infrastructure, buildings, crops and other property; and the loss of entire places or ways of life.\n\n\n\nLoss and damage can come from extreme events like floods, hurricanes and wildfires, which are growing more frequent and severe with human-caused climate change. Or it can come from slow-moving disasters, like sea level rise and ocean acidification, caused mainly or entirely by climate change.\n\nAn unequal burden\n\nLoss and damage is often framed as a matter of climate justice—noting that the low-income nations that have done the least to cause climate change also have the fewest resources to withstand it.\n\nThis idea was central to the earliest conversations about “loss and damage.” In the early 1990s, as the United Nations prepared to create what is now the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a group of small island nations, realizing their vulnerability to rising seas, lobbied for the UNFCCC to include a fund through which the wealthy nations most responsible for climate change would compensate the hardest-hit nations for the “loss and damage” from sea level rise.\n\n\n\nSince that time, low-income nations have indeed proved especially vulnerable to climate change related disasters. In summer 2022, for instance, when a third of Pakistan was flooded by extreme rains, the crisis was deepened for happening in a country with few spare resources to give food, water, shelter and healthcare to the millions of people displaced.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, no country is immune to loss and damage. And in some places, like low-lying coastal areas lost to sea level rise, no amount of money may be enough to prevent devastating harms from climate change.\n\nAssessing loss and damage\n\nLoss and damage from climate change is plainly important, but it is not easy to assess.\n\n\n\nAny effort to measure loss and damage will involve putting a value not only on property damage and loss of livelihood, but also on “non-economic losses.” That can include human lives, the loss of species, and even the loss of places and cultures, as when the melting of sea ice takes away the hunting traditions of Indigenous people in the Arctic. A full accounting of loss and damage must also wrestle with the role of climate change in disasters that may have multiple causes. Consider, for example, a drought made more intense by both climate change and overuse of scarce water for agriculture. How much loss and damage came from human-caused climate change, from the “normal” course of nature, and from other human changes to the environment?\n\nResponses to loss and damage\n\nCompensation for loss and damage remains an active point in climate negotiations. In November 2022, at the 27th annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP27), the UNFCCC finally agreed to create and operationalize a fund to help lower-income countries respond to and recover from climate change related harms.1 However, the details of how large this fund will be, who will pay into it, and how it will be distributed are all still under debate. A transitional committee will be established and will meet in 2023. It is tasked with making recommendations in November 2023, at COP28.\n\n\n\nThere is also much that people can do to help prevent future loss and damage. At this point, some harms from climate change are inevitable. But through mitigation and adaptation—that is, actions to slow climate change and to better withstand it—there is still time to minimize those harms and create a future where climate change is as manageable as possible.\n\nUpdated December 1, 2022.","article_title":"Loss and Damage","article_authors":["Deborah Campbell","Senior Staff Scientist","Co-Lead","Mit Lincoln Laboratory Climate Change Initiative","With Aaron Krol","Mit Climate Portal Writing Team"],"article_image":"https://climate.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2022-10/4971019988_ae1a384067_o.jpg","article_pub_date":null,"article_url":"https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/loss-and-damage","article_html":"<div><p>&#8220;Loss and damage&#8221; is a term used by the United Nations to describe the harms inflicted by climate change that go beyond what people can adapt to.
