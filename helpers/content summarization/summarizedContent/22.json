{"summary":["Biofuels can be used as replacements for petroleum-based fuels like gasoline and diesel. When the plants used to make biofuels grow, they absorb CO 2 from the air, and it’s that same CO 2 that goes back into the atmosphere when the fuels are burned.

There are many challenges to making bioFuels that are truly carbon neutral, including the energy for processing, transportation, even the fertilizers used to grow plants. The details of how biofuELs are made and used are very important for their potential as a climate solution, says Dr. Michael Schulder of the University of California, Los Angeles. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will release a new report on the future of biofuel on September 3, 2020. The report will look at how biofuel can help reduce the greenhouse effect and climate change, and how we can use it to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. It will also look at ways to reduce CO 2 emissions without changing a lot of our infrastructure, such as existing pipelines and roads. The study will be published in the journal of Environmental Research, published by the American Chemical Society (ACS) in association with the Center for Biofuels, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable energy development in the United States and around the world.

Biofuels can be used as replacements for petroleum-based fuels like gasoline and diesel. As we search for fuels that won’t contribute to the greenhouse effect and climate change, biofuels are a promising option because the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) they emit is recycled through the atmosphere.

There are many different biofuels in production or under development, and even the same biofuel might be made in more than one way. If we want biofuels to help protect our planet from climate change, every step in the process matters. 1) Agriculture.Most biofuels come from farms. Good farming practices can help trap extra carbon in the soil. On the other hand, many fertilizers release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 2) Feedstock. The &#8220;feedstock&#8221; is just the plant or other organic material used to make a biofuel. Do we use something valuable and hard to grow, like corn or palm oil? Or cheap plants that don&#8217;t need good farmland? Or waste from other industries, like logging and cooking? 3) Processing. Turning feedstocks into biofuels is not easy. Facilities may have to extract energy-rich oils or starches from the raw material, or ferment, heat, or chemically treat the feedstocks. 4) Energy. Every method of processing biofuels takes energy, which we can get from carbon-free sources like solar or wind, or by burning fossil fuels. 5) Transportation. Most biofuels today can&#8217;t be moved through the pipelines we use for oil and gas. That leaves trucks, trains and ships, all of which emit greenhouse gases. 6) Use. Eventually, the fuel is burned and the carbon inside it is emitted back into the atmosphere. It can replace gasoline or jet fuel, or it can be used more like natural gas, to provide electricity or heat.\" src=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/Biofuels%20Infographic_0.png\" class=\"align-center\" width=\"5500\" height=\"5600\"><p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Published September 3, 2020.</p>\n</div>","article_abstract":null}
