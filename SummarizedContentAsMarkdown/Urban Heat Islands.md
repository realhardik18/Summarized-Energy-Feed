# Urban Heat Islands

### The urban heat island effect is a phenomenon whereby cities experience higher air temperatures than the surrounding countryside. As the planet warms, urban heat islands will only intensify those higher temperatures. Cities can expand parkland, plant street trees, and install “green roofs” designed to harbor plant life. Cool roofs feature bright coatings that reflect more sunlight and, therefore, absorb less heat. Cool pavements work similarly. They are made of brighter materials, like concrete and light-colored aggregates, or have been treated with reflective coatings. A model by the MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub estimated that, if widely implemented, cool pavements could reduce the frequency of heatwaves by 41% across all US urban areas. The heat islands are one of the most pressing issues facing cities today. Thankfully, several approaches can help cities keep their cool even amidst a changing climate. The most obvious way to fight the urban heat Island effect is to reintroduce vegetation. The next step is to build cool roofs and pavements that reflect less sunlight and reflect less heat, as well as to install ‘cool’ pavements on roads and buildings. The goal is to reduce the number of heat-related deaths in cities by as much as 20% by 2050, according to a study by the University of California, Los Angeles. The study was published in the journal of Climate Change and the Environment (CCD) on April 16, 2021.
