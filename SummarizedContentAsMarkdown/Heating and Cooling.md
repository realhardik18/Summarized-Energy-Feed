### As incomes rise and our planet warms, the number of air conditioning units is expected to triple from 1.6 billion units today to 4.8 billion in 2050. Just under half of heating systems sold around the world in 2020 run directly on fossil fuels, such as oil, natural gas, and propane. “Passive houses” can use up to 80% less energy for heating and cooling through measures like airtight windows, insulation, using heat-absorbing building materials like concrete, and carefully thinking through how buildings are shaded and oriented. "Ground source" or "geothermal" heat pumps that draw their heat from underground can be especially efficient ways to heat and cool homes and offices. If these electric heating andcooling systems are powered by a clean electric grid, they have roughly a quarter the emissions of a natural gas furnace. More than 120 countries have agreed to phase out hydrofluorocarbons as refrigerants, which scientists estimate will lower global warming by almost 1 degree Fahrenheit. Also, setting stricter standards for setting stricter energy efficiency for air conditioners could lower energy costs, encourage investment in cleaner cooling systems, and reduce energy costs for homes and businesses. The U.S. is home to 40% of all air conditioner units, and we can reduce the climate impact of these by switching to lower-carbon ways to cool and heat our buildings. It’s also possible to use less energy by adding insulation and installing energy-efficient windows and doors. Heat pumps are significantly more efficient than other kinds of electric heating.
