### Investors trade over $250 trillion worth of stocks, bonds and other long-term investments in global capital markets every year. A growing number of investors are interested in the connection between climate change and the assets they buy and sell. Climate change poses two kinds of risks that investors might consider: physical and transition. Investors need tools for making informed decisions about climate change across all their investments, say the authors of a new paper on investing in climate-friendly stocks and bonds. The authors conclude that climate-focused investing is a large and growing force in worldwide capital markets and that investors need to be aware of the risks and benefits of different types of investments and how to make informed decisions on which ones to buy, sell and hold. They conclude that investors who want to make corporate corporate decisions on climate change must be at least partly partly subjective and should be able to disagree about how the same assets should be rated by rating agencies. They also argue that investors and regulators worry about “greenwashing,” or their investment offerings being more environmentally friendly than they really are. The study is published in the latest edition of the Journal of Sustainable Investing, which is published by the University of California, San Diego, on behalf of the World Resources Institute (WRI) (http://www.wri.org/sustainable-investing/climate-focused-investors-should-be-at-least-partly-imaginative-and-transparent-in-their-investments").
