### Since 1979, climate change has increased the risk that a storm will develop into a ‘major’ hurricane by around 5% every ten years. Warm seawater supplies more heat to a hurricane, increasing its wind speed. Hurricane-proofing buildings and infrastructure is one way to reduce risk to coastal communities. Another option is to restore wetlands, which can slow down storm surges. Experts say coastal areas need to think more about this so-called ‘managed retreat’ to reduce the risk from sea level rise and hurricanes.Published November 30, 2020. Back to Mail Online home.
