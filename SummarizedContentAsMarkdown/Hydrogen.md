### Hydrogen is the lightest chemical element and the most abundant chemical substance in the universe. Using fossil fuels or clean electricity, we can produce hydrogen gas, which can be stored, transported, and burned to provide power. Unlike most fuels, hydrogen does not produce the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) when burned. This means that burning hydrogen fuel does not contribute to climate change. Today, hydrogen is mainly used in the petrochemical, food processing, and fertilizer industries, and in cars with hydrogen fuel cells. Countries such as Japan are exploring its use in public transportation. It can provide long-term energy storage for the electric power sector, fuel for heavy duty transportation, and heat for industrial processes requiring high temperatures, like steel or concrete production. The attraction of the hydrogen economy is as a tool for fighting climate change, by replacing fossil fuels in some of the hardest parts of our economy to decarbonize. A key barrier that needs to be overcome to support this transition is the lack of hydrogen infrastructure such as hydrogen pipeline networks, widespread production facilities, and hydrogen fueling stations. The idea of a ‘hydrogen economy’ was first introduced in the 1970s, to describe using hydrogen as a fuel for the transportation sector at a time when oil prices were rising quickly. It is hoped that hydrogen fuel will be used to replace fossil fuels by the end of the 20th century in many parts of the world, including transportation, energy storage, and manufacturing, and for clean energy production.
