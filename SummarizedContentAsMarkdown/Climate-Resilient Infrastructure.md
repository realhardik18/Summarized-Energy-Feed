# Climate-Resilient Infrastructure

### “Climate resilience” refers to how well something withstands, and how quickly it recovers from, natural hazards made worse by climate change. As climate change causes disasters like floods, hurricanes, heatwaves, and wildfires to become more severe or reach new areas, much of our infrastructure will need to be redesigned and rebuilt for climate resilience. Research from the MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub found that investments in climate-resilient construction can prevent enough damage to pay for themselves in as little as two years in hazard-prone areas. Every dollar invested in resilience can save up to $11 in repair costs over time, according to the report. The report will be published in print on September 20, 2021, and online on September 25, 2021.
