### More than half of humanity chooses to live and work in cities. Estimates range from a little over one-half to two-thirds of global energy consumption is tied to urban economies. Rising sea levels and stronger storms can lead to dangerous coastal urban flooding. Cities can reduce emissions even more by establishing a circular urban economy, in which residents and businesses consume less, reuse materials and products, and recycle. The challenge for cities is not only to contend with climate change, but to do so in a humane and equitable way that benefits the whole planet, say the authors of the new book, "Resilient Cities," which will be published in March 2021. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, on behalf of the University of California, Los Angeles, at a cost of $39.99.
