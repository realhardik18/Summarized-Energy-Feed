### Forests cover about 30% of the Earth’s land surface. As forests grow, their trees take in carbon from the air and store it in wood, plant matter, and under the soil. If not for forests, much of this carbon would remain in the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), the most important greenhouse gas driving climate change. Careful forest management can therefore be an important strategy to help address climate change in the future. If done worldwide, natural regeneration of forests could capture up to 70 billion tons of carbon in plants and soils between now and 20508—an amount equal to around seven years of current industrial emissions. Combining natural regeneration with thoughtful afforestation and reforestation is an important option for combating climate change, say the authors of the new book, ‘Forests as a climate solution’ (Cambridge University Press, 2021) The book is published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the World Resources Institute (WRI) (www.wri.org).
