### Freight transportation plays an important role in our global economy. Billions of tons of cargo are transported around the world each year by trucks, planes, ships, and trains. This transportation makes up 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and as much as 11% if warehouses and ports are included. Growing economies in Asia, Africa and Latin America are expected to triple global demand for freight by 2050. Modern engines, low-carbon fuels, and more efficient practices, such as using vehicle space more efficiently or reducing freight demand, can reduce freight emissions, but faster progress is needed to achieve our global climate goals, says the World Resources Institute (WRI) In the U.S. alone, freight transport emits over 20% of the world’s black carbon, a powerful short-lived climate pollutant. To see a change in freight emissions we must turn over old equipment faster, while scaling new technologies, fuels and efficiency measures at the same time, WRI says. The WRI report will be published on September 4, 2020, and will be available on the WRI website and in print at www.wri.com/infographic/freight-transport-in-the-world-2020-2040-worldwide-enemies-and-benefits-of-cleaner-further-growth-for-climate-change-at-a-global-scale.
