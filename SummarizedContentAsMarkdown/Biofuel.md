### Biofuels can be used as replacements for petroleum-based fuels like gasoline and diesel. When the plants used to make biofuels grow, they absorb CO 2 from the air, and it’s that same CO 2 that goes back into the atmosphere when the fuels are burned. In theory, biofuel can be a “carbon neutral” or even “ carbon negative” way to power cars, trucks and planes. There are many challenges to making bioFuels that are truly carbon neutral, including the energy for processing, transportation, even the fertilizers used to grow plants. The details of how biofuELs are made and used are very important for their potential as a climate solution, says Dr. Michael Schulder of the University of California, Los Angeles. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will release a new report on the future of biofuel on September 3, 2020. The report will look at how biofuel can help reduce the greenhouse effect and climate change, and how we can use it to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. It will also look at ways to reduce CO 2 emissions without changing a lot of our infrastructure, such as existing pipelines and roads. The study will be published in the journal of Environmental Research, published by the American Chemical Society (ACS) in association with the Center for Biofuels, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable energy development in the United States and around the world.
