### Permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. It lies beneath a vast portion of the Earth’s surface. 15% of land in the Northern Hemisphere contains permafrost. The Arctic has already warmed by almost 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit, or just over 3 degrees Celsius — three times as fast as the rest of the world. Climate change is also affecting parts of the Arctic in other ways — like increasing wildfires — that further thaw permaf frost. We will have less room in our carbon budget — that is, the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions we can emit to limit global warming below a certain amount — aspermafrost continues to thaw. But our efforts to curb emissions can help control how much permaf Frost will eventually thaw in the future.Published August 4, 2012, at 10:30 a.m. ET.
