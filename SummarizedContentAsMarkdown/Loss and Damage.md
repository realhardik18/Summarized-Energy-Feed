### “Loss and damage” is a term used by the United Nations to describe the harms inflicted by climate change. It can include lives lost; monetary costs from the destruction of infrastructure, buildings, crops and other property; and the loss of entire places or ways of life. In November 2022, the UNFCCC agreed to create and operationalize a fund to help lower-income countries respond to and recover from climate change related harms. However, the details of how large this fund will be, who will pay into it, and how it will be distributed are all still under debate. In summer 2022, when a third of Pakistan was flooded by extreme rains, the crisis was deepened for happening in a country with few spare resources to give food, water, shelter and healthcare to the millions of people displaced. In some places, like low-lying coastal areas lost to sea level rise, no amount of money may be enough to prevent devastating harms fromClimate change. At this point, some harms fromclimate change are inevitable. But through mitigation and adaptation, actions to slow climate change and to better withstand it, there is still time to minimize those harms and create a future where climate change is as manageable as possible. For more information, visit the UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, November 27-28, 2022, or go to http://www.unfCCC.org/climatechange.
