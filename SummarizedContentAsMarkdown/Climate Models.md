### Climate models are computer programs that simulate weather patterns over time. By running these simulations, climate models can estimate the Earth’s average weather patterns under different conditions. Scientists use climate models to predict how the climate might change in the future, especially as human actions, like adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, change the basic conditions of our planet. Newer computer technology allows for more accurate simulations of complex features like clouds and the water cycle. At the same time, advances in computer technology are making it possible to simulateWeather patterns on a finer scale than ever before.
