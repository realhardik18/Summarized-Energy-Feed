### Ocean acidification refers to a gradual increase in the acidity of ocean water, caused mainly by human-emitted carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) mixing with the water. Since the Industrial Revolution, the ocean surface has, on average, become approximately 30% more acidic worldwide. The speed of ocean acidification today is estimated to be 10 to 100 times faster than any change in the ocean’s chemistry in the past 100 million years. Ocean acidification will have different effects on different marine plants and animals. Many seagrasses and algae that rely on CO 2 to make energy may benefit from higher ocean CO 2 levels. Other marine organisms will have a harder time surviving in a more acidic ocean, particularly those with delicate shells and skeletons, which may dissolve more easily when seawater becomes more corrosive. Habitat destruction, ocean warming, and other changes may make the effects of ocean Acidification even more damaging to ocean life.Published September 8, 2020.
