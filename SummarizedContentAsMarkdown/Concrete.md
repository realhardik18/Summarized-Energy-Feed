# Concrete

### Concrete is among the world’s most consumed materials, second only to water. It also produces large amounts of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, mostly from a manufacturing process that emits carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Yet, the world will need concrete to build infrastructure that can cope with climate change and population growth. To make low-carbon concrete a reality, manufacturers, engineers, and scientists are working to lower the CO 2 emissions of cement production and change the ingredients used in concrete. If they are successful, this highly consumed material could have a far lower impact and even act as a “carbon sink,” with a net-negative effect on the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Click here to see data from the infographic above in a table. The key ingredients of concrete are water, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates (or gravel), chemical additives, and, most importantly, cement. Cement is what binds all of these ingredients together to give concrete its durability and distinctive, grey appearance. The process to make concrete with net-zero emissions will require more ambitious actions, almost certainly including some amount of carbon capture in cement production. There are many ways to reduce or even eliminate the emissions from cement production, some of which are available today, others may require more investment.
