### Renewable energy is energy from sources we cannot run out of. Common types of renewable energy are wind, solar, hydropower, biomass and geothermal. Renewable energy produces far less carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and other harmful greenhouse gases and pollutants. In 2018, renewable energy sources made up 26% of the world’s electricity, and that number is rising every year. More than 60% of renewable electricity worldwide comes fromHydropower. More energy storage, backup generation, strategies to match electricity use with times of high power generation, and infrastructure for long-distance power transmission will be needed to add more renewable energy to the electric grid. How much of our energy we get from renewables will depend on their ability to compete with other low-carbon technologies, such as carbon capture and hydrogen storage and hydrogen fuel cells.
