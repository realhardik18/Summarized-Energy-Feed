### The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) is a federal program charged with coordinating climate research. Every four years it is required to produce a National Climate Assessment. Four NCAs have been produced since 1990, and the structure and development of each has varied depending on guidance and feedback from federal agencies and the public. The most recent assessment, NCA4, was developed in two volumes. It gives particular attention to observed and projected risks, how those risks can be reduced, and implications for society under different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. It also emphasizes the regional aspect of climate impacts and adaptation, drawing upon resources like NOAA’s State Climate Summaries to inform the development of the extensive regional chapters. The report gives examples of community-based actions to reduce climate change-related risks, increase resilience, and improve livelihoods. Many of these have been compiled as case studies in NOAA's Climate Resilience Toolkit. The NCA provides authoritative science to inform decision-making related to the impacts of climate change in the United States. It will be published September 3, 2020, and will be available to the public for free on the USG CRP website and on the National Climatic Data Center's free Web site. It is available in English, Spanish, German, and Italian. It was released in 2017 and serves as the scientific foundation for the second volume, Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the US, which will be released in 2018.
