# Coastal Ecosystems and Climate Change

### Coastal ecosystems are the unique habitats formed by plants and other organisms that can thrive at the borders between ocean and land. As the plants in these ecosystems grow, they pull carbon out of the air and store it in their tissue, roots, and the soil beneath them. Because coastal ecosystems are such potent "carbon sinks," the loss of these habitats is an important driver of climate change. Conservation groups and others are protecting undeveloped land behind coastal ecosystems to help them adapt to sea level rise. The Netherlands has started shoring up some of the salt marshes in front of its dykes to protect this infrastructure, and its citizens, from sea-level rise. Some environmental policymakers have also proposed paying coastal landowners for the carbon stored in the ecosystems to prevent their destruction to prevent climate change, and to protect coastal communities from the threat of storms and sea level rises. For more information on protecting coastal ecosystems, go to: http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/15/climate-change-and-environment/index.html#storylink=cpy. We are happy to clarify that this article is based on an earlier version of this article that stated that we were talking about mangrove forests, which are found in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. In fact, mangroves store three to five times as much carbon per acre as other tropical forests. We would like to make clear that this is not the case, and that we are referring to a type of coastal forest that is found in temperate areas and higher latitudes.
