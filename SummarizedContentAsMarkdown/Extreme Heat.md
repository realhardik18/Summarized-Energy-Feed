### Extreme heat is the leading weather-related cause of death in the United States. Climate change has led to about 1.8° F (1° C) of average global warming so far. Hot, humid days don’t just feel muggier than dry days, they are also more dangerous. If more steps are not taken to stop climate change in the next few decades, deadly combinations of heat and humidity will reach some of the most densely populated parts of the world, say scientists. The rise in extreme heat, like other effects of climate change, is likely to fall hardest on already vulnerable populations, especially in the developing world, the authors say. They say governments can help protect people by setting up public cooling stations for those without air conditioning, growing green infrastructure that provides natural cooling, and creating early warning systems so people are not caught outdoors. They also say regions can update their infrastructure to cope with levels of heat it was not built for—especially energy and water systems whose breakdown could be deadly in a heatwave.Published June 23, 2022, in the open-access issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, on sale now.
