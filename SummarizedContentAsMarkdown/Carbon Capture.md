### Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a collection of technologies that can combat climate change by reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. The idea behind CCS is to capture the CO 2 generated by burning fossil fuels before it is released to the atmosphere. Most current CCS strategies call for the injection of CO 2 deep underground. The main use for CO 2 today is enhanced oil recovery: pumping CO 2 into oil wells to help flush out hard-to-extract oil. Pure CO 2 is also used in greenhouses to grow plants. CO 2 could also be made into useful products like plastics, building materials like cement and concrete, fuels, futuristic materials like carbon fibers and graphene, and even household products like baking soda, bleach, antifreeze, inks and paints. For large-scale implementation of CCS, utilization is projected to use less than 10% of the captured CO 2. This creates what is called “negative emissions” because it takes CO 2 from the atmosphere and stores it. Other possible uses of CO2 include making chemicals or fuels, but they require large amounts of carbon-free energy, making the costs too high to be competitive today. But “utilization” could help create markets for carbon capture, and make it cheaper for companies to invest in capturing their CO 2 emissions.
