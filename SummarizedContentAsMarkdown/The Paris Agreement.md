### The Paris Climate Agreement is a treaty that brings all the world’s peoples into a common effort to combat climate change. The parties to the Agreement are sovereign states who agree to take actions to meet an ambitious goal: to hold the rise in global temperature “well below” 2 degrees Celsius. The main focus of the Paris Agreement is lowering greenhouse gas emissions by a system of pledge and review. The Agreement also covers many other aspects of a global response to the climate threat, including provisions to strengthen efforts to adapt to a changing climate. But serious challenges remain to bring its over 190 diverse participants to the required level of joint effort, the authors say. The success of the Agreement over coming decades will ultimately depend on leadership by the wealthier and larger emitting countries, they say. It was essential for developing countries to join in pledging NDCs, and their emissions are growing faster than those of wealthy countries. The agreement reaffirms an obligation by the richer nations to provide financial and technological aid to developing countries. It also sets rules and procedures for international cooperation, where countries that exceed their N DCs can sell the excess reductions to other countries to help meet their pledges. The U.S. rejoined the Agreement in 2021, with commitments beyond 2030 to be pledged in 2025. The United States faces no formal sanctions for declaring an unambitious NDC or stingy offer of financial aid. It means that the willingness of nations to undertake substantial, and perhaps costly, action depends on confidence in the design of the regime.
