### Fusion energy is the source of energy at the center of stars, including our own sun. Scientists are still figuring out how to keep a man-made star burning on earth and produce electricity from it economically. Since fusion creates electricity, it would plug right into our existing electric infrastructures. It will need to be deployed at large scales though, because it needs a minimum amount of output power to work. So you cannot have fusion powering just one home, like solar panels; the minimum would be about 1,000 homes. The fuel source, hydrogen, is everywhere. If you take the top inch of water off the Boston Harbor, this would give us enough hydrogen to power Boston for 50 years. For this reason, reliable, affordable fusion power could help meet the world's energy needs without contributing to the warming of our planet. published September 4, 2020. Back to Mail Online home.
