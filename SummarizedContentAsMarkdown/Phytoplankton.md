### Phytoplankton are microscopic plant-like organisms that live in the oceans, lakes, and rivers. They play a large role in the natural carbon cycle, helping to regulate the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere and keep the Earth’s climate in balance. Climate models suggest that, as rising temperatures change the ocean currents and stability of the upper ocean, the supply of nutrients from the deep ocean is likely to be reduced. This could slow down the biological pump, leaving more CO 2 on the atmosphere, where it will contribute to further climate change. The biological pump is not the only way the oceans absorb and transport carbon. Colder water absorbs more CO2 than warmer water, and sinking cold water transports some of this CO 2 to depth. Through this “pump”, the oceans have already absorbed about one third of human CO 2 emissions, leading to ocean acidification.Published March 14, 2022.
