# Net Zero Emissions

### Some actions, like using electricity from a fossil fuel-fired power plant, lead to greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere. These greenhouse gas “emissions” are the root cause of climate change. By lowering one’s own emissions as much as possible, and then “canceling out” any remaining (or “residual”) emissions, an organization can reach net zero emissions. As long as humans keep adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, climate change will continue to get worse. Almost every country on Earth signed the Paris Agreement in 2015, pledging to reach netzero emissions in time to hold global warming to no more than 2° C and strive for 1.5° C. With worldwide “net zero” emissions, it may be possible to reverse some (but not all) of the catastrophic effects of climateChange. It is even possible to go further, and take more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere than we emit now. The goal of climate action must be the goal of action if we are finally finally to stabilize climate change, writes Andrew Keen. The U.S. is the only country in the world that has not reached net zero, he says, and it is unlikely to do so in the next few years or even in the 2030s or 2050s. The Paris Agreement is the best chance for the world to achieve net zero by 2050, Keen says. But it is still possible to have a net zero planet by the end of the century.
